<!--
open all xml files and pull the title subject catergory
User pics the flashcardset by title but can sort by subject/category
Then user can pic "Learn" with options such as show anwsers or show questions
Can have timer, can shuffle cards.

(can mark cards as "learned" to not have them show up during study session)




Or user can edit flashcards to update errors or info

To create new, they would specify title subject and category then add individual cards with relevant info




Going to need flashcardcollection class, flashcard class, parser to get flashcards
GUI and relevant GUI things
